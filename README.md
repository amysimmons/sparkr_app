### Problem

Everyones talking about Tinder but Tinder isn't for everyone, particularly for people over 50. There are dating sites out there for people in this age range but these sites aren't simple like Tinder and charge like crazy. 

We wanted to create a web application that catered for people over 50 to meet a potential love interest or two! The application needed to be simple and more than about appearance. And most importantly a bit of fun!

### Libraries, Gems and other stuff

- Faye
- handlebars.js
- dropzone.js

```ruby
gem 'figaro'
gem 'font-awesome-rails'
gem 'omniauth'
gem 'omniauth-facebook'
gem 'carrierwave'
gem 'cloudinary'
gem 'mini_magick'
gem 'private_pub'
gem 'thin'
gem 'dropzonejs-rails'
gem 'normalize-rails'
gem 'geocoder'
```

### Solution

Sparkr - where the sparks fly!

### Sore bits

- Facebook authentication - works in development but not production (app domain name the cause)
- Faye - running two servers on Heroku
- Fireworks

### Cool beans

- Sparka is working.. kinda..
- Moments animation and tracking of moments 
- Instant messaging

### The 'I' in Team

- TJ: Instant messaging
- May: Getting the back-end working
- Amy: Dropzone and ajax
- Julia: Styling

### What's next?

- filtering users
- make it responsive
- email verification
- forgot your password
- matches notification
- fireworks functionality
- facebook authentication
- upload photos from facebook
- user profile photo display on edit
- ajax on all pages
