=== Sparkr

==== Problem

We wanted to create a web application that catered for people over 50 to meet a potential love interest or two! The application needed to be simple and more than about appearance. And most importantly a bit of fun!

==== Solution

Sparkr - where the sparks fly!

==== Sore bits

- Facebook authentication - works in development but not production (app domain name the cause)
- Faye - running two servers on Heroku
- Fireworks

==== Cool beans

- Sparka is working.. kinda..
- Moments animation and tracking of moments 
- Instant messaging

==== The 'I' in Team

- TJ: Instant messaging
- May: Getting the back-end working
- Amy: Moments animation
- Julia: Styling
